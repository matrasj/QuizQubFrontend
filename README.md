The project QuizQub has been created by me because I wanted to learn Java and Angular interview questions so I want to create some kind of quiz platform. In the Internet I saw project by created in ThymeLeaf so I decided to write it on my own using Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate for backend and Angular & TypeScript for frontend. During work on the project I practised my Angular skills and I learn about Angular Materials components.

In app we have 3 roles: Admin, Teacher and Student. As an admin we can handle with accounts (update, delete). As a teacher we can create questions for subjects, update them and see user sessions history with their scores. Eihter as a teacher and student we can see some charts ( see session's number for every subject and average score).
Application is still being developed by me and I add new functionalities. I also can create questions and test my knowledge in Java and Angular simultaneously ðŸ˜€.

Above I attach some screenshots.
